# Sphoorthy Masa Portfolio

Serverless API endpoint for the Sphoorthy Masa UX research portfolio. The endpoint hosts an assistant called **Sporty** that answers questions using project context and safe, concise messaging.

## Features
- CORS-limited POST endpoint for chat-style requests.
- Uses Google's Gemini model via `@google/generative-ai`.
- Supports passing short conversation history for contextual replies.
- Friendly guardrails tailored to Sphoorthy Masa's portfolio content.

## Quick start
1. Ensure Node.js 20 or later is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set your Gemini API key:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
4. Deploy or run with your preferred serverless platform (for example, Vercel). The repository includes `api/portfolio-chat.js` as the handler.

## API
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/portfolio-chat`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "query": "string",
    "history": [
      { "role": "user" | "assistant", "content": "string" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  { "text": "Assistant reply" }
  ```

Send the most recent user prompt in `query` and optionally include previous message pairs in `history` for better context. The endpoint returns a concise text response generated by the Gemini model.

## Scripts
- `npm run build` — placeholder build command.
- `npm start` — placeholder start command.

## Notes
- Requests from origins other than `https://sphoorthy-masa.vercel.app` are blocked by the configured CORS policy. Update `origin` in `api/portfolio-chat.js` if you need to allow additional domains.
- Avoid wrapping imports in `try/catch`; let deployment logs surface missing dependencies during builds.
